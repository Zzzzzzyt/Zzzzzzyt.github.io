# About this site
Just a minimal blog, mostly for keeping ideas and weird stuff.
Hosted on github at [Zzzzzzyt/Zzzzzzyt.github.io](https://github.com/Zzzzzzyt/Zzzzzzyt.github.io)

You might complain about its strange design, like some sort of raw html site in the 90s.
So yes, this site is extremely **un**-powerful, by design, as I gave up Hexo for more flexibility and complete control over the generation process.
Maybe I'm just reinventing the wheel, but whatever, it's great fun!

Don't read `generate.py` if you are a professional. You might find it disgusting.

This site might cover software development, competitive programming, physics, math, strange ideas and tricks, and many other bizzare content.
I have no idea what I'm writing.

# About myself
I usually appear online under the name _Zzzyt_. It's a completely artificial word with no meaning, and I never knew how to pronounce it. My user IDs and other links are in the [Links&Credits](links.html) page.

I'm a member of [Hell Hole Studios](https://blog.hellholestudios.top/). Never mind its name, that's just a Tell Tale Game parody.

I've explored many areas of programming, including:
- competitive programming ~~(as a career)~~
- games (mostly in java)
- java web (using Tomcat)
- general frontend design
- physics simulation
- tiny but useful tools
- a bit of machine learning

Currently I use java as my first language for large projects and use python for scripts. I'm trying to learn node.js though.
Read my github page for more info.

As for culture circles, I'm a fan of the Touhou Project.
I've been playing Minecraft since my childhood, and it remains my favorite game.
Besides I like almost everything about areospace. Or just anything scientific enough.

Or just anything that could catch my attention XD

Now just read those articles! You'll probably find something interesting.
